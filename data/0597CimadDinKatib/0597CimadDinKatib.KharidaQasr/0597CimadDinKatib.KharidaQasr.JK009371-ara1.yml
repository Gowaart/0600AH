90#VERS#COMMENT##: In digital text this is marked as volume 7, but in pdf found online it is volume 10, 
 although the edition itself does not bear a number at all. From line 791 onwards and again from line 2174 onwards
 the three-pipe sections are in fact subdivisions of the particular poet's biography (poetry ordered alphabetically
 according to the rhyming consonant in the first case, a selection of prose writings in the second case).
 As there is no tag for subdividing a biography I've used the general markers for subdivision. Text seems to be of good quality though includes a lot of 
 punctuation.
 	UPDATE: I have deleted the three-pipe subdivisions of biographies, as they would clash with general
 textual subdivisions in the following volumes.
