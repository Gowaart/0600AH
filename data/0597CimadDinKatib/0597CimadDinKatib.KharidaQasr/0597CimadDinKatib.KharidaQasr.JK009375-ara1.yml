90#VERS#COMMENT##: In digital text this is marked as volume 1, but in
    pdf found online it is volume 7,  although the edition itself does not
    bear a number at all. Quality is similar to other parts. Biographical
    entries were numbered but I've used regex to turn all those into bio-
    tags, so they're not numbered anymore. There are apparently a lot of
    gaps in the manuscript, many poems have imcomplete hemistiches. In the
    digital edition this results in a lot of things like ". . .", which
    looks ugly but which I haven't replaced.
