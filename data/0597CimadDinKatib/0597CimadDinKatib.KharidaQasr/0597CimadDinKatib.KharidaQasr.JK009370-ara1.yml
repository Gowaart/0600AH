90#VERS#COMMENT##: This is only vols. 5-6 (the vols dealing with Iraq)
    of the entire 20-volume work. Text had no pre-tagging and was rather
    messy with pipes and % symbols, most of which I cleaned up  with regex.
    There is however still a lot of punctuation in the text.  I have marked
    the poetry by using regex. All entries on individual poets have been
    marked as  biographies. At the beginning of volume 5 a title is missing
    (would be page 3, but digital text only starts at page 5). Apart from
    that text quality seems to be ok.
