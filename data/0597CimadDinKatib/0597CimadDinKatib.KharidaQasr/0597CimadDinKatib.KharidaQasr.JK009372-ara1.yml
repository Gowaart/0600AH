90#VERS#COMMENT##: See merger-issue for general KharidaQasr. This is
    volume 11-13 in archive pdf  while digital text says volume 8-10.
    Edition itself does not bear either numbering, as the voumes of
    separate qisms (devoted to regions) are numbered separately. I have
    continued the structural logic of  the previous part. There are several
    blank pages in the pdf, digital text follows this identically  (lines
    2315-2318) and on line 2303 the typist has left a message to notify of
    this. Also similar to last volume, there are subdivisions in biography
    for which I previously fixed by using 3 pipes. However, in this volume,
    this  creates some problems because there are more subdivisions which
    clash with this system, so I decided instead to  detag all these
    subdivisions. This results in a number of long biographies but is more
    clear. In the  last volume, the editor has regularly inserted pages of
    historical info in the body text. This info is not based on any
    manuscript so I have marked this with the editor-tag.  Text seems to be
    of good quality. I noticed one mistake (wasn't looking for any): name om
    line 14184 reads أمين الدولة but should أمين الدين
