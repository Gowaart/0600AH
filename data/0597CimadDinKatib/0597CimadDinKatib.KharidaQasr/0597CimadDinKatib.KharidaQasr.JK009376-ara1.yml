90#VERS#COMMENT##: In digital text this is marked as volume 2, but in
    pdf found online it is volume 8,  although the edition itself does not
    bear a number at all. Quality is similar to other parts. As in the other
    parts I have introduced poetry tags through regex. There is a strange
    situation with this edition in that page  215 notes that here ends the
    part on Persia in the book and that then follows the Syrian part, but
    two pages later the edition simply picks up again with Khorasani and
    Transoxanian poets. Perhaps a sign of significant  manuscript variation?
    I have simply followed the edition, but this is something worthy of
    further  investigation. The last biography is very lengthy and includes
    a subdivision of poetry by rhyming letter, but I have not tagged these
    divisions to keep intact the biography.
